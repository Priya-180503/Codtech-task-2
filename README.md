Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) Project Overview
The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a widely used synchronous communication protocol in embedded systems. It enables full-duplex data transfer between a master device (e.g., a microcontroller) and one or more slave devices (e.g., sensors, memory chips, or other peripherals). Implementing SPI using Verilog involves designing the master, slave, or both, with precise timing control to adhere to the SPI protocol specifications.

Project Objective
Purpose: Design and simulate an SPI module in Verilog to facilitate serial communication between devices.
Goals:
Create an SPI master and/or slave module.
Support full-duplex communication with configurable clock polarity and phase (CPOL, CPHA).
Implement multi-slave support using chip select signals.
Validate data integrity with testbenches and waveform analysis.
Key Features
Configurable Parameters:

Data width (e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit).
SPI mode (4 modes based on CPOL and CPHA).
Clock speed (divisible from system clock).
Full-Duplex Communication:

Simultaneous transmission (MOSI) and reception (MISO) of data.
Multi-Slave Support:

Dynamic selection of slaves using SS (Slave Select) lines.
Protocol Compliance:

Synchronous communication with proper setup and hold times.
Clock-driven data transfer.
SPI Protocol Basics
Signals:

SCLK: Serial clock generated by the master.
MOSI: Master Out Slave In (data line for master-to-slave communication).
MISO: Master In Slave Out (data line for slave-to-master communication).
SS: Slave Select (active-low signal to select a specific slave).
SPI Modes (determined by CPOL and CPHA):

CPOL: Clock polarity (idle high or low).
CPHA: Clock phase (data sampled on leading or trailing edge).
Submodules
SPI Master:
Generates the clock (SCLK).
Drives MOSI and reads data from MISO.
Controls SS signals to select slaves.
SPI Slave:
Responds to masterâ€™s clock and SS.
Receives data on MOSI and transmits on MISO.
High-Level Design
Inputs:

clk: System clock.
reset: Reset signal.
data_in: Data to be transmitted.
start: Start signal to initiate a transfer.
CPOL, CPHA: SPI mode configuration.
slave_select: Selects a specific slave.
Outputs:

data_out: Received data.
busy: Indicates ongoing transmission.
sclk, mosi, ss: SPI output signals.
